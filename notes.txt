CLI for now? Frontend maybe later.

What format is SICK in? Can you get a json? Tabletop Simulator? You will need to use that format.

1st step is about modeling the data shape?

Consideration for superlatives and a "big" change in board state (need to define big and knowledge of board state)

The art of describing Ravages could be its own thing. Most changes to game state happen then. (Dahan fighting back too.)

Piece of data needed for a turn:
I. Card/Spirit Board
II. Presence
III. Board pieces (Letter and numbers) (Land types? Could talk about growth options)
IV. Fear
V. Blight
VI. Invader Deck
VII. Other Tokens (Beast/Wilds/Disease/Etc.)


Assume Json file for now, worry about details later

Parse vs. Validate
Validation is asking a question of something you already have, and rejecting if its not in the right shape
Parsing is the act of insuring creation of correct data shapes

Starting out: Get a card, put out a prose description.
Anatomy of a Spirit Card:
Name
Speed
Range
Target
Energy Cost
Elements Granted
Card type (Minor/Major/Innate)
Effect
    (Parsers?)
(Thresholds/Choices)
(Unique to Spirit vs. general pool)

* Given a json files that contains cards, can select a card and have it produce a prose output

* Output includes the Name
* Output includes the Speed
* Output includes the Range
* Output includes the Target
* Output includes the Energy Cost
* Output includes the Elements Granted
* Output includes the Effect

The anatomy of a power use into prose, bare bones

Spirit, Invader, Power Being Used, Land, Results?

Spirit{ name: name}
Invader{ name: name}
Power{ done already}
Land{ type: type}

I will want string concatenation and multiple scripts

So the data will go into a power concatenator that refers to multiple scripts, probably at random, and then back to the concatenator and then back out.

The data needs to be turned into prose. Every power will have to a prose translator? Or a generic prose translator.

A simple script could be

“#{spirit} does #{effect}, against #{invaders} at #{land}”

Eventually I will need a “significance” metric.

What makes a good saga? What makes a good summary?
